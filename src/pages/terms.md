The Trial Membership gives access to all LUMACS sessions, socials, events and the ability to borrow equipment for a 2 week period starting at the first session/event/social the trial member attends, the society exec can extend this period for any or all trial members, and allow any or all trial members access to any session/event/social.

## Important safety waiver

Circus skills are a physical activity that comes with inherent risks to people who take part. If you have pre-existing injuries or disabilities and you aren't sure you can be safe using certain equipment, please tell a member of the exec and discuss techniques to reduce risk, or do not use it.

### General props

Almost all of our props can cause light injury (minor bruising, friction burn, minor cuts, etc.). LUMACS is not responsible for injuries occurring when our equipment is misused or used without the supervision of an exec member with experience using that prop.

### Aerial equipment

Use of aerial equipment will cause bruising and friction burns which can be reduced by wearing appropriate workout clothing. If you are unsure if your clothing is appropriate, please ask the aerial coordinator or health and safety officer. Fatigue on aerial equipment can increase risk of injury. If you need a break, tell the aerial coordinator and take one. Aerial equipment also carries the risk of greater injury if used incorrectly. LUMACS is not responsible for injuries if you misuse or use aerial equipment without the supervision of the aerial coordinator.

### Stilts

Prolonged use of stilts can cause or exacerbate circulation issues in the feet and legs. If you are affected by this, please tell your spotter or the health and safety officer immediately. Misuse of stilts can cause greater injury. LUMACS is not responsible for injuries if you choose to use stilts without a spotter and/or the provided safety equipment.

# Fire supplies and equipment

Fire, fire equipment and fuel can cause injury. To use fire you must be sober, in appropriate non-flammable, non-meltable clothing (details of what is appropriate will be shared before each fire session; if you are unsure, ask) and must not have used aerosols. You must be signed off by an exec member on the props you want to use, and it is highly recommended to practice with the fire equipment before setting it on fire. Props must have excess fuel removed before being set on fire. Avoid getting paraffin in your mouth and eyes. If you get paraffin in your mouth and eyes please tell health and safety or another member of the exec immediately. After utilising fire equipment, you will need to wash your hands with soap and warm water to remove the paraffin. LUMACS is not responsible for injuries caused by misuse of fire equipment.
